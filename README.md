# Face Recognition Project
This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV. It consists of three main components: training a model, creating a dataset of face images, and recognizing faces in real-time.

# Technology Used
OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision and image processing.

Python: The programming language used to develop the scripts.

NumPy: A library for numerical computations (often used alongside OpenCV).

Matplotlib: For visualizing images (if included in your scripts).

# Setup Instructions

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

# Installation

Install the OpenCV library:

pip install opencv-python

# Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

Run training.py: This script trains a model using face images.

python training.py
Run face_datasets.py: This script captures and saves face images into a dataset.

python face_datasets.py
Run face_recognition.py: This script performs real-time face recognition.

python face_recognition.py
# Usage

Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.

Follow the prompts in the terminal as you run each script.
